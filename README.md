# Vacunatory System

This is one of my projects using Java at University.
I replicated a vacunatory system. 
There are different types of vaccines for each type of person.
The type of vaccine to apply depends on the age, priority and if it is essential or not.
Also, the stock of the vaccines and its expiration date is controlated.
And, all this is automatic through the code.
